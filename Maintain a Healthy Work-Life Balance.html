<font face="arial" size="5"><i>In today's fast-paced and highly connected world, the boundaries between work and personal life have become increasingly blurred. However, it's crucial to recognize that overextending oneself in the pursuit of professional success can have detrimental effects on health, relationships, and job performance. When individuals prioritize self-care, leisure, and time spent with loved ones, they often find themselves more energized, motivated, and creative when it comes to their work.</i></font>

They are better equipped to tackle challenges, make sound decisions, and contribute to their organizations' success.</i></font>

It allows individuals to pursue their passions, hobbies, and interests outside of their professional roles. This diverse range of experiences contributes to personal development, creativity, and a broader perspective on life.</i></font>
