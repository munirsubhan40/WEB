                           <p><font face="arial" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MaryBeth Hyland started her company Spark Vision to help businesses create and maintain collaborative and inclusive office cultures. Specializing in millennial engagement, Hyland and Spark Vision offer workshops to help offices foster collaboration and connections among workers.

                            A child of abuse, Hyland has faced a lot of challenges to her self-worth and confidence. She uses her survival daily as a way to motivate her to succeed in business, drawing on the experience of her past to connect with the people she works with. According to her website, Hyland says she thinks that her experience makes her more successful in her company.
                            
                            The takeaway:
                            Everyone has a past—and not all are good. But whatever you’ve gone through, using your background and experience to inform your business can be great, even if your experiences aren’t. In Hyland’s case, she uses a troubled childhood to motivate and drive her, and her business benefits from it.</font></p>

                            <p><font face="arial" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to entrepreneur stories, there are few as powerful as Bianca Lily’s. Bianca learned in high school that there is a predetermined path that people were meant to take: First university, then a lifetime of working diligently for one company until you retire at age 65. Fortunately, Bianca listened to a cassette tape of a man named Tony Robbins and she decided she was going to break the chains of convention and surge onto the battlefield of business and follow her own path.

                                However, even positive shifts are driven by the meanings we ascribe to them. From that day forward Bianca defiantly classified herself as “unemployable” because she “never wanted to do a Monday to Friday, nine-to-five thing.” She cannot even remember the number of jobs she held in her early adult life, always hungry for something that would finally fulfill her ambitions.</font></p>

                                <p><font face="arial" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She became self-employed as a personal trainer, driven by a desire to help people discover how to live healthy lifestyles. But as many great entrepreneur stories go, Bianca soon realized she had not yet discovered her passion and was a slave to her work. She felt trapped once again.

                                On her quest to find fulfillment, Bianca left her job and began traveling the world with her husband, looking for an opportunity that would blend her passion with profitability. After achieving a certain amount of success in network marketing, Bianca attended Business Mastery, seeking to create massive, unparalleled growth within her business.
                                
                                As most entrepreneur stories go, Bianca’s life changed with a rude awakening. “I realized I wasn’t a business owner or operator. I thought I had a business, but I can’t sell it. I don’t own the business that I’m a network marketer for. What I have is a residual income that is going to allow me to do something greater.”
                                
                                Bianca learned that she craved the life of an entrepreneur. She realized that she is always looking for that spark in people – that vision that lights a person up and compels them to take action immediately. It was the entrepreneur’s true gift of constantly scouting talent and cultivating potential that truly brought her joy.</font></p>

I am only ninty years old.I am share with you my past language,In my early life,I did my first job when i was only 10 years.I did it because I want be people call me a doctor ,my parents always told me that my great son would grow up to become a doctor.My father brother(uncle) is also a doctor. I didn't have any friends,only my cousin was my friend but my uncle used to take to take both of his sons to his clinic. So I went to work in a pharmacy. At that time, I didn't know about money. I must have been around 10 or 11 years old. Eventually, my father gave me permission, and I was very happy that I would also become a doctor.
                                    
                                    I worked in a pharmacy for two months, and the owner of the pharmacy treated me with respect. But at once time,pharmacy owner told me to cleaning at the pharmacy, and my parents didn't send me back to work there. 
                                    I continued my studies, and after eight class,I joined another pharmacy and worked there for three months before quitting. When I was in the ninth classs, my parents had initially enrolled me in a biology course to become a doctor. I studied biology for two weeks, but then I switched to computer science. I didn't tell to my family members about this change until three days later when I informed my parents. They supported my decision, then I obtained  my matric marks 1100/934 in matriculation in 2020. 
                                    then i got admission to a cadet college because I was interested in joining the army. However, after two months, I was rejected, and I couldn't secure admission to an ICS program that year. So, I decided to join an office as a data entry specialist at Apex Office. I worked there for some time and eventually moved into telemarketing, where I worked as a customer service representative (CSR) for seven months. Later, I was promoted to Team Leader (TL) within the same office and held that position for five months. I left the company because I got admission to college to pursue my ICS.
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    I've been studying along side gaining work experience in different offices, and I have accumulated four experience in college time over six months. At present, I am not working in a job; I've enrolled in university with becholar's of buissness and information of technology subject , and I recently applied for an internship at a software house. However, they told me your experince not match this job you are a intellegent go to your skill office they will give you a handsome salery because you have many skill in short time but we require 5 to 6 specific skills in computer language, Firstly you learn java script,html+css and SQL.
